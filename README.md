# Welcome to the NEA repo 👋

_(NEA stands for Non-Exam Assesment)_

This is the repository for files for the computer science NEA 🌵

It shall evolve into a huge project at some point...
for now it's just the humble beginnings 😌

## But what is the project about?

It will be a shared calendar 🎉
I can imagine what you're thinking - "they already exist 🥱"

Correct, but most all lack the _speed_ and _simplicity_, and that is where this web app can come in - mainly made for my friends and family, will make it as easily as possible to add events and see when others are free/busy.

Some of the things to make it speedy... 🔍

- One of the fastest sign-up processes you have ever seen 🚀
- A natural language → calendar event input
- Fast loading assets ⚡️
- And probably some more magic... ✨

There will be some other features too, like file sharing, photo uploads, contact sharing, storing bank details (for easy money transfers) or pinned notes - but for now, let's focus on getting the basics down!

### 🚧 Progress Tracking 🚧

- [ ] Make the events only show up on the month that they are in and not all the other ones.
  - [ ] Check what month currently showing up (in the front-end).
  - [ ] Split the event files into separate months (on back-end).
  - [ ] Use a dynamic @app.route in the api to send whichever month was requested.
  - [ ] The month can be specified in the request URL with a number or month name.
